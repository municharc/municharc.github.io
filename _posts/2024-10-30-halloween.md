A few days ago we hung posters all over the campus advertising a mysterious screening of the scariest movie you will ever see. All seats were filled at the start of the movie with 15 people showing up to watch a horror movie.

The scary movie turned out to be [**Dominion**](https://watchdominion.com), a documentary which showcases the practices of the animal agriculture industry. After about 1 hour some people started leaving. Deeply affected, some could not continue watching. At the end, 7 people watche through the whole 2 horrible hours and stayed for a discussion.

We thank everyone who came for staying to watch a movie they did not expect. If you do not want to be responsible for the horrors of animal farming, you have to be vegan.
