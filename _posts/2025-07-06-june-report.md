teaser: A fun and productive month!
---

June was an action-packed month for us! We kicked off the semester with a potluck dinner where we welcomed many fresh faces to the club. We also had a fun WereWolf social and a special dinner with the Eat&Meet club. On the activism front, we held four outreach events—three in the city and one in Garching—engaging with students and the public and raising awareness. We also organized a postering action across different campuses in the city and launched our conscientious objection campaign. A big thank you to everyone who participated and helped make these events a success!
