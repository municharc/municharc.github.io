Recently, the Munich Animal Rights Club went on a workshop weekend to the Science and Study Center Raitenhaslach near Burghausen 🏰

We had an amazing time competing in our MARC Olympiad 🏆, planning and organizing upcoming club activities ✊, enjoying great vegan food 🍲, and of course playing games at the hotel 🎲

It's incredible to have such a motivated group of animal rights advocates and we are excited for the activities we have planned! 🤩
