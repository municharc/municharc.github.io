To add to our ongoing plant-based mensa campaign, we've started a new campaign on the topic of experimental animal use in study programs. Our goal is to work with students, professors and the student representation, and to further the use of alternatives to achieve the same (or better) learning outcomes!

If you have ever been in a class where you've had to experiment on animals, we could use your inputs in this short survey: [https://forms.gle/eatkqXoZoF5AHoNY8](https://forms.gle/eatkqXoZoF5AHoNY8).
